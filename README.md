Problem statement: TO ANALYZE AND MODEL THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SALINITY AND TEMPERATURE IN OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES‚Äù. Ocean salinity and temperature are two critical parameters that influence ocean circulation and climate patterns. Understanding the complex relationship between these variables can help predict future changes in the ocean's behavior.

The dataset used is sourced from the CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) dataset, which includes historical oceanographic data. In this problem, we aim to build a predictive model using polynomial regression to predict temperature based on salinity values. Polynomial regression is employed because the relationship between salinity and temperature is often non-linear, and a simple linear model may not capture the complexity of the data.
